# Diabetes Health Indicators
Hello!

This is an application that can serve as a self-regulation and check whether a user is likely to develop diabetes. 

It is based on a machine learning model that makes predictions based on patterns in persons's health data.

### Introduction

Hereâ€™s how it works:

- Learning from Examples: First, the model is trained using a large set of health records collected previously. Each record has details about a personâ€™s health and a label indicating whether they have diabetes (1) or not (0). 

- Finding Patterns: As the model processes more examples, it notices which factorsâ€”like high blood pressure or certain age rangesâ€”are often seen in people with diabetes. It also learns which patterns are typical in people who donâ€™t have diabetes.

- Making Predictions: Once itâ€™s trained, the model can then be used with new health records. When given the details of a new person, it checks the patterns in that personâ€™s data and compares them with the patterns it has learned. If the data aligns closely with patterns seen in people with diabetes, the model predicts "1" (meaning the person likely has diabetes). If it doesnâ€™t match those patterns, it predicts "0" (meaning the person likely does not have diabetes).

- Confidence Level: The model in this study gives a confidence level, like saying thereâ€™s an 80% chance the person has diabetes. This helps understand how strongly the model "believes" in its prediction.

In short, a machine learning model for diabetes prediction works by learning from many examples to find patterns, then uses those patterns to make educated guesses about new cases. This doesnâ€™t replace a doctor's expertise but can serve as a helpful tool to support decision-making.



### Would you be interested to know why the model came to a certain result? 

There are different tools that help people understand why a machine learning model made a particular prediction. This study tests one of them called "SHAP".

Think of SHAP as a way to "look inside" the model to see which factors were important in making its decision.
Since machine learning models are often complex and don't explain themselves, SHAP steps in to solve this problem by giving each feature (such as blood pressure or age) a score, called a "SHAP value." 
This score tells us how much that specific factor contributed to the final prediction.


### Please proceed as following:
- fill in the data to send it to the model
- after you get the result, view the explanations 
- share your thoughts :)

Important note: this is not a test of your knowledge here. This is a test of the interpretability of the method I'm researching. 

Your feedback and thoughts on the format of the explanations is very valuable and I encourage you to say whatever you think. 
That way we can determine the shortcomings and strengths of the method and find potential areas for improvement. 

Thanks for agreeing to participate in this study!
